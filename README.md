# ConnectX
This project in reinforcement learning has been inspired from the game of connect4. The game of connect4 consists of a 2D grid of 6 rows and 7 columns. In the game each of the two players take turns dropping a piece of their color in a column of their choice. The objective of the game is to connect 4 in a row horizontally vertically or diagonally. The game ends if either player achieves the objective or the board is full such that the player cannot make a move.

In the project the dimensions of the game board can be varied from 0-20. An AI agent has been created using minimax to play the game.

The game has 3 different modes of Player vs Player, Player vs AI and AI vs AI.

## How to run the game:

1. Install python on your PC.

2. Use pip to install numpy pandas and pygame libraries.

3. Download and extract all the files in this repository.

4. Run Main_Menu.py

P.S: Running the game for the first time may take pygame considerably more time to load the interface.
